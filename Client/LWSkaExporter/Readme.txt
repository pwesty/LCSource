This is a source code distribution of Serious Engine SKA (SKeletal Animation) 
model format exporter for Lightwave 7. 

The code is released under GNU GLPL2 (GNU General Library Public License 
version 2). The complete license text is available in file COPYING. To compile
the plugin, you will need Lightwave SDK package, obtainable from 
www.lightwave3d.com.

The project was built using Microsoft VisualC++ 6.0 w/sp5 and tested for 
Lightwave 7.0. Other compilers and some older versions of LW (namely 6.5) 
might or might not work - we didn't design or test for that.

The code is free (see COPYING for exact definition of "free software"), so
there are no warranties. We supply the plugin and the source for your
convenience. You may use it as you like as long as you obey the license. Feel
free to use it as example for creating SKA export plugins for other modeling
packages and/or converters. Note that if you make modifications to the plugin
you need to have the new sources.

The source is not really best example of clean code, but it does the work.
